## About The Project

This project create a classifier using Naïve Bayesian technique.

Also Evalute tarining data based on confusion matrix:

Classification Error: Overall, how often is the classifier correct?  
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN +FN) 

Classifier Error: Overall, how often is the classifier correct? 
Error = (FP + FN) / (TP + FP + TN +FN) 

Classifier Sensitivity: When the actual value is positive, how often is the prediction correct? 
Sensitivity = TP / (FN + TP) 

Classifier Specificity: When actual value is negative, how often is the prediction correct? 
Specificity = TN / (TN/FP)
